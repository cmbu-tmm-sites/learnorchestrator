Scheduled tasks can be edited to change parameters such as date, time, and recurrence of the scheduled [workflows](/Library/Worflows/).

Input parameters set when creating the scheduled task are read-only and cannot be edited. To change these parameters, create a new scheduled task for this workflow.

You can see all the [workflows](/Library/Worflows/) executions related to the scheduled definition and you can suspend any further the scheduled executions:
