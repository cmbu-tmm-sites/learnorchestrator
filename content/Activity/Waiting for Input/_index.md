<strong>Deployments Search & Sorting Capabilities:</strong>

You can use search to locate deployments based on a broad range of values, not just the deployment name. 

{{< img src="/Deployments/Deployments/deployment-search.png" alt="Search Deployments with MOAD and S3 Strings" >}}

You can also locate deployments based on:

<ul>
    <li>Name, description, and who created the deployment</li>
    <li>Resource properties, such as resource name, IP address, image, region, tags, cloud account, or primary MAC address</li>
</ul>

When you use the search, observe the following advantages and constraints:

<ul>
    <li>The search is not case sensitive</li>
    <li>You can only search on initial strings, not embedded strings. For example, you can retrieve results for a network named <i>MyResourceName</i> using <i>My</i> or <i>MyResource</i>, but not ResourceName.</li>
    <li>You can search for values that might exist in more than one value type. For example, you can search deployments that contain a specific resource name and a specific tag. The search format must include a space between the values. The space is an implied <i>AND</i>. For example, you can search for MyResourceName <i>192.0.2.0</i></li>
</ul>

If you are looking for projects or resource types, use the filter rather than the search. You can also use the filters with the search to locate deployments.

{{< img src="/Deployments/Deployments/deployment-filter.png" alt="Filtering by Cloud Account and Sorting by creation." >}}

You also have the ability to <strong>Sort</strong> your deployment list by multiple criteria such as:

<ul>
    <li>Name (ascending)</li>
    <li>Name (descending)</li>
    <li>Price (ascending)</li>
    <li>Price (descending)</li>
    <li>Created on (ascending)</li>
    <li>Created on (descending)</li>
    <li>Expires on (ascending)</li>
    <li>Expires on (descending)</li>
    <li>Last updated (ascending)</li>
    <li>Last updated (descending)</li>
</ul>
