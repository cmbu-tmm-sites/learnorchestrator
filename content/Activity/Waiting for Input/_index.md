[workflows](/Library/Worflows/) can request additional user input before they can finish.
[workflows](/Library/Worflows/) requiring further user interaction suspend operations until the requested input parameters are provided by the user. [workflows](/Library/Worflows/) define which users can provide the requested information and send requests for interaction accordingly. 

[workflows](/Library/Worflows/) waiting for user input are also displayed in the Recent Workflow Runs panel of the [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) Client [dashboard](/Dashboard/) and the top-right notification menu.
