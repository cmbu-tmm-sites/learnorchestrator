As an administrator, you can configure a connection between your [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) deployment and a Git repository or project.

To use Git for management of your [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) object inventory, you must configure a connection to your Git repository by using the [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) Client.

Verify that your [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) environment uses a vRealize Automation license.

You can add multiple Git repositories but only one can be active at a time. You can change the selected Git branch at any time after you finish the initial Git configuration.
