Git History displays the current differences between the local version branch and the selected Git repository branch. You can expand the entry for any modified [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html)object to view the version differences.

Push your changes to local [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) objects to your integrated Git repository. 
You can also push local changes on a per object level by clicking the Version option displayed at the bottom of the object editor.
The process of pushing and discarding change sets to a [Git repository](/Administration/Git-Repositories/) is not limited by group permissions. Therefore, a [workflow](/Library/Worflows/) developer from one group can push or discard local changes made by another developer.

You can discard a local change set by select Discard all.
