[vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) includes a collection of standard plug-ins

Each plug-in exposes an external product API to the [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) platform. 
Plug-ins provide inventory classes, additional object types for the scripting engine, and publish notification events from the external system. 

[vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) provides an [API Explorer](/API-Explorer/) that you can use to search the [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) API and see the documentation for JavaScript objects that you can use in scripted elements.

Each plug-in also provides a library of [workflows](/Library/Worflows/) for automating the typical use cases of the integrated external products.
You can use a [model-drive framework to develop plug-ins](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Orchestrator/8.0/com.vmware.vrealize.orchestrator-plugindev.doc/GUID-D0F5FFF2-DD0C-440F-B1ED-25EB97D884BF.html) for [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) 8.x.

With [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) plug-ins, you can access and control external technologies and applications. Exposing an external technology in an [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html) plug-in lets you incorporate objects and functions in [workflows](/Library/Worflows/) and run [workflows](/Library/Worflows/) on the objects of that external technology.

The external technologies that you access by using plug-ins include virtualization management tools, email systems, databases, directory services, and remote control interfaces.
